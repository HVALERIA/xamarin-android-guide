# Android Activities

In this chapter you learn about the `Activity` class, the major building block of your app's user interface (UI). You also learn about using an `Intent` to communicate from one activity to another.

## Activities

An `activity` represents a single screen in your app with an interface the user can interact with. An email app for example might contain several Activities:

- Message Activity
- Compose Activity
- Settings Activity
 
 ![Email app activities][1]

 Your app is made up of a collection of activities that you create yourself, or that you reuse from other apps.

 - In an app, they should be one Activity designated as the main activity. This is the Activity that is started by Android.
 - An Activity can start another activity
 - Each time a new activity is started, the previous activity is stopped and put in a back stack. The system maintains the previous activity state.
 - The activity is notified of each state by the system using life cycle methods.


### Creating activities

To implement an `Activity` in your app, do the following:

- Create a class that inherits from the `AppCompatActivity` or `Activity`
- Implement a basic UI for the Activity in an XML layout file.
- Decorate the class with the `[ActivityAttribute]`

### Create the activity

To create an Activity in Visual Studio, **Add New** file, choose **Android** and choose **Activity** and give a name to the class.

When you create a new activity from the wizard, you get the code as follows:

```csharp
[Activity(Label = "ChatActivity")]
public class ChatActivity : Activity
{
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // Create your application here
    }
}
```

`[Activity(Label = "ChatActivity")]` decorates the class as an Android activity and generates the required xml tags in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

!!! info "Use `AppCompatActivity` for backward compatibility"
    For the app to be backward compatible, its recommended to derive your activity class `AppCompatActivity` instead of `Activity`


!!! question "What is the OnCreate" method?
    The `OnCreate` method is a required life cycle method that is called when the activity is created. You setup the layout file for the activity in this method.

### Implement the UI

Create the UI xml layout file for the activity in the **Resources** -> **layout** folder. In Visual Studio, use the **Add New** file menu to add a new Android layout file.

!!! info "Naming conventions"
    You should adopt a naming convention for your layout files. Generally for the activity, you should start with `activity_` prefix, e.g for the compose activity, the layout file should be called `activity_compose.axml`.

### Associate the activity with the layout file

Once the layout file is created, use the `SetContentView` method in the `OnCreate` method of the activity as follows:

```csharp hl_lines="3"
protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);
    SetContentView(Resource.Layout.activity_compose);
}
```

The `SetContentView` takes in an resource id. Remember the layout file is referenced using the `Resource.Layout.<layout-name>` class.

## Intents

Each activity is started or activated with an `Intent`, which is a message object that makes a request to the Android runtime to start an activity or other app component in your app or in some other app.

When your app is first started from the device home screen, the Android runtime sends an `Intent` to your app to start your app's main activity (the one defined with the `MAIN` action and the `LAUNCHER` category in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file). This is the `Activity` with the `MainLauncher = true` set.

To start another activity in your app, or to request that some other activity available on the device perform an action, you build your own intent and call the `StartActivity()` method to send the intent

In addition to starting an activity, an intent can also be used to pass data between one activity and another. When you create an intent to start a new activity, you can include information about the data you want that new activity to operate on.

## Intent types

Intents can be explicit or implicit:

- **Explicit intent**: Used to start activities using their fully qualified name.
- **Implicit intent**: Used to start activities without specifying the fully qualified name. The system will use the default registered activity or show options to choose th activity.


### Starting activities with explicit intents

To start an activity from another activity, you use the explicit intent, e.g the following will start the `ChatActivity` from `MainActivity`:

```csharp
// Create intent with the type of the Activity
Intent intent = new Intent(this, typeof(ChatActivity));

// Start the activity
StartActivity(intent);
```

The first line creates the intent, passing `this` as the `Context`. Then the second line starts the activity.

!!! question "What is `Context`"
    Context is the class that contains the runtime information about the environment in which the activity is running in. An activity inherits from `Context` so we can pass in this whn the context is required.

??? question "What starts the activity?"
    Android uses a process called the `ActivityManager` to run the activity. When you call `StartActivity` the information in the intent is sent to the `ActivityManager`. You can also call activity manually from the command line using `adb am`

### Manually closing an activity

The started `Activity` remains on the screen until the user taps the <kbd>Back</kbd> button on the device, at which time that `Activity` closes and is reclaimed by the system, and the originating `Activity` is resumed. 

When can also close the `Activity` by using the `Finish` method as follows:

```csharp
private void CloseActivity()
{
    Finish();
}
```


### Passing data between activities

You can also pass on data when you start an activity. They are two ways to pass data to the called activity:

- Set data as a `URI`
- Pass data using `Intent` extras

### Passing data using Intent uri

The Intent uri can only hold one piece of information, the URI representing the location of the data you want to operate on. The following code passes the telephone number to the `ChatActivity` as follows:

```csharp            
Intent intent = new Intent(this, typeof(ChatActivity));
intent.SetData(Android.Net.Uri.Parse("tel:0114804898"));
StartActivity(intent);
```

The `SetData` method takes in the uri.

On the called activity, you can retrieve the uri using the `Data` property on the `Intent` property as follows:

```csharp
// This is in the called Activity
if(Intent.Data != null) {
    Log.Debug(TAG, $"{Intent.Data}");
}
```

### Passing data with `Intent` extras

In the first (sending) Activity, you:

- Create the Intent object.
- Put data or extras into that Intent.
- Start the new `Activity` with `StartActivity()`.

In the second (receiving) `Activity`, you:

- Get the Intent object the `Activity` was started with.
- Retrieve the data or extras from the `Intent` property.

### Add the extra data

We can either create a `Bundle` or pass the extras directly to the intent object. The following code passes the extra as single fields:

```csharp
Intent intent = new Intent(this, typeof(ChatActivity));
intent.PutExtra(EXTRA_USERNAME, "codeguru");
intent.PutExtra(EXTRA_USERNAME, "Hi there!");
StartActivity(intent);
```

We also defined the constants in the `MainActivity` as follows:

```csharp
public static readonly string EXTRA_USERNAME = "com.peruzal.praat.USERNAME";
public static readonly string EXTRA_NEW_MESSAGE = "com.peruzal.praat.NEW_MESSAGE";
```

You can pass serializable data with the `PutExtra` method. To retrive the data on the called activity with use the `Intent` object as follows:

```csharp
if(Intent.HasExtra(MainActivity.EXTRA_USERNAME)) {
    var username = Intent.GetStringExtra(MainActivity.EXTRA_USERNAME)
}
```

!!! info "Passing complex objects"
    To pass complex objects with the intent, you can use `Newtonsoft` JSON. First convert the data into json and deserialize on the called activity. Alternatively you will have to implement the `Serializable` interaface. Its easy to serialize and deserialize from json.


### Using the `Bundle`

You can put all the extras in the `Bundle` and the then use the `PutExtras` method to add the bundle to the intent as follows:

```csharp
Intent intent = new Intent(this, typeof(ChatActivity));

// Create a bundle object
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();

// Add the extras
bundle.PutString(EXTRA_USERNAME, "codeguru");
bundle.PutString(EXTRA_NEW_MESSAGE, "Hi there");
intent.PutExtras(bundle);
StartActivity(intent);
```

Get the data in the called activity:

```csharp
if(Intent.Extras != null)
{
    var username = Intent.Extras.GetString(MainActivity.EXTRA_USERNAME);
    Log.Debug(TAG, username);
}
```

### Getting data from an activity

You can get data from the called activity. Here are the steps:

- Start the activity with the `StartActivityForResult()` method instead of `StartActivity`
- Create a new `Intent` in the launched started activity and return the data in the `Intent`
- Implement the `OnActivityResult` in the calling activity to process the returned data


### Start the result

You need to specify a request code when you launch the activity for result:

```csharp
Intent intent = new Intent(this, typeof(ChatActivity));
StartActivityForResult(intent, USERNAME_REQUEST);
```

The `USERNAME_REQUEST` is defines a field

```csharp
private readonly int USERNAME_REQUEST = 100;
```

In the called activity we will add the following code:

```csharp
btnDone.Click += delegate {
    var editUsername = FindViewById<EditText>(Resource.Id.edit_message);
    var username = editUsername.Text;

    Intent intent = new Intent();
    intent.PutExtra("USERNAME", username);

    SetResult(Result.Ok, intent);
    Finish();
};
```

In the above, we have a done button thats wired to a click event. Within the event, we find the edit text and get the username.

We use the username and pass it as the data to the intent. We then use the `SetResult` method, set the result to be OK and pass in the intent object.

### Retrieving the passed data

To retrieve the returned data we use the `OnActivityResult` result method and get the data from the intent. The `OnActivityResult` is used to receive data from other activites, so we need to check if the request code matches first and also is the result was not cancelled as follows:

```csharp
protected override void OnActivityResult(int requestCode, [GeneratedEnum] Result resultCode, Intent data)
{
    base.OnActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    
    // Check if its the same request code used to start the acitivity
    if(requestCode == USERNAME_REQUEST && resultCode == Result.Ok)
    {
        // Check if the key is in the bundle
        if (data.HasExtra("USERNAME"))
        {
            var username = data.GetStringExtra("USERNAME");
            Log.Debug(TAG, username);
        }
    }
}
```

### Activity navigation

Any app of any complexity that you build will include more than one `Activity`. As your users move around your app and from one `Activity` to another, consistent navigation becomes more important to the app's user experience. Few things frustrate users more than basic navigation that behaves in inconsistent and unexpected ways. Thoughtfully designing your app's navigation will make using your app predictable and reliable for your users.

Android system supports two different forms of navigation strategies for your app.

- **Back (temporal) navigation**, provided by the device Back button, and the back stack.
- **Up (ancestral) navigation**, provided by you as an option in the app bar.

### Back navigation, tasks and the back stack

Back navigation allows your users to return to the previous Activity by tapping the device back button. Back navigation is also called temporal navigation because the back button navigates the history of recently viewed screens, in reverse chronological order.

The back stack is the set of each Activity that the user has visited and that can be returned to by the user with the back button. Each time a new Activity starts, it is pushed onto the back stack and takes user focus. The previous Activity is stopped but is still available in the back stack. 

![Back stack navigation][2]

Because an app can start an Activity both inside and outside a single app, the back stack contains each Activity that has been launched by the user in reverse order. Each time the user presses the Back button, each Activity in the stack is popped off to reveal the previous one, until the user returns to the Home screen.

#### Tasks

Android provides a back stack for each `task`. A `task` is an organizing concept for each Activity the user interacts with when performing an operation, whether they are inside your app or across multiple apps. Most tasks start from the Android home screen, and tapping an app icon starts a task (and a new back stack) for that app. If the user uses an app for a while, taps home, and starts a new app, that new app launches in its own task and has its own back stack. 

If the user returns to the first app, that first task's back stack returns. Navigating with the Back button returns only to the Activity in the current task, not for all tasks running on the device. Android enables the user to navigate between tasks with the overview or recent tasks screen, accessible with the square button on lower right corner of the device.

![Recents screen][3]

!!! info "Managing tasks"
    In most cases you don't have to worry about managing either tasks or the back stack for your app—the system keeps track of these things for you, and the back button is always available on the device.

    There may, however, be times where you may want to override the default behavior for tasks or for the back stack. 

## Up navigation

Up navigation, sometimes referred to as ancestral or logical navigation, is used to navigate within an app based on the explicit hierarchical relationships between screens.

With Up navigation, each `Activity` is arranged in a hierarchy, and each "child" `Activity` shows a left-facing arrow in the app bar   Up button (in app bar)  that returns the user to the "parent" `Activity`. The topmost `Activity` in the hierarchy is usually `MainActivity`, and the user cannot go up from there.

![Up navigation][4]

For instance, if the main `Activity` in an email app is a list of all messages, selecting a message launches a second `Activity` to display that single email. In this case the message `Activity` would provide an Up button that returns to the list of messages.

### Implementing up navigation

There two ways to implement the up navigation:

- Using [Activity(Parent = "")]
- Using the [MetaData()] attribute

!!! info "MetaData supports backward compatibility"
    Using the `MetaData` supports backward compatibility on older Android devices. Its recommended to use both methods to create a consistent up navigation experience.

#### Implement back using `[Activity]` attribute

Decorate the descendant activity with the `[Activity]` and specify the `Parent` type as follows:

```csharp
[Activity(Label = "ChatActivity",  Theme = "@style/AppTheme", ParentActivity = typeof(MainActivity)]
public class ChatActivity : AppCompatActivity
{ ... }
```

The `ParentActivity = typeof(MainActivity)` specifies that `MainActivity` is the parent of the `ChatActivity`. In the `AndroidManifest.xml` file the following will be generated:

```xml
<activity 
    android:label="ChatActivity" 
    android:parentActivityName="com.peruzal.helloworld.MainActivity" 
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme" 
    android:name="md5982a942979eaad736ab55d3d1d394dbb.ChatActivity" />
```

#### Implementing up using the `[MetaData]`

To use the `[MetaData]` attribute you should give the parent activity a name using `Name` in the `[Activity]`. The name should be fully qualified as follows:

```csharp
[Activity( Name = "com.peruzal.helloworld.MainActivity", ...)]
```

then in the descendant activity, e.g the `ChatActivity` is the child of the `MainActivity` as follows:

```csharp
[Activity(Label = "ChatActivity",  Theme = "@style/AppTheme", ParentActivity = typeof(MainActivity))]
[MetaData("android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY", Value = "com.peruzal.helloworld.MainActivity")]
public class ChatActivity : AppCompatActivity
{...}
```

!!! caution "Meta attribute name"
    The name should be exactly be `android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY` and the value be the fully qualified name of the activity. The back button will not show if the name does not match `android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY`.
